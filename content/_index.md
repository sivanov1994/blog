# Welcome to my website!

I'm Simeon, Systems Administrator. This is where I document my learning journey, tackle technical challenges, and share practical insights. From Kubernetes and cloud-native tooling to terminal workflows and note-taking strategies. I’ll be sharing my projects and the lessons I learn along the way.
