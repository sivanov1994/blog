Hello, I'm Simeon — a systems administrator by profession, and a passionate Linux enthusiast by heart.

Over the past few years, I’ve delved deep into the world of Linux — driven by my love for free and open-source software and the sheer power and flexibility it provides. I thrive in the terminal, live in Neovim, and genuinely enjoy exploring the boundaries of what can be automated, optimized, and understood.

Right now, I’m walking the path toward DevOps. I'm actively studying cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes, and the tools that make modern infrastructure scalable, resilient, and declarative. YAML has unexpectedly become one of my favorite formats — structured, readable, and beautifully strict.

I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and building in public. This blog is both a record of what I discover and an invitation to others who walk a similar path.

Welcome — and thank you for reading!
